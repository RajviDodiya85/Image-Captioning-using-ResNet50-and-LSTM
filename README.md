# Image-Captioning-using-ResNet50-and-LSTM
Image Captioning is a key problem in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the goal is to automatically generate meaningful textual descriptions for images. This project presents an AI-based Image Captioning system that combines ResNet50 for image feature extraction and LSTM networks for sequence generation.
